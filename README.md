#Star Wars RPG
This is my second application using jQuery. It is a Star Wars RPG.
##How to Play
Each character has a certian number of health points shown below 
their picture. The object of the game is, after choosing a character, to 
fight the remaining characters and beat them all by depleting them of 
health points in combat. Choose a character to play as by clicking 
on the character's picture. Choose your first opponent by clicking on 
their picture. Attack your opponent by clicking on their picture. 
When you attack an opponent, you do a certain amount of damage. 
On subsequent attacks, the amount of damage you do increases by the 
amount of damage your attack originally caused. Every time you attack 
an opponent, they counter-attack and cause a certain amount of damage 
to you. If you run out of health points before defeating all opponents, 
you lose. If you defeat all opponents before running out of health 
points, you win. There is at least one way to win the game no matter 
which character you chose to be. 
##Other Notes
Have fun! If you win a round your reward is to try another round! :)
